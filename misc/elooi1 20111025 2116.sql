 (470,'Automation Rules and Best Practices','<p>We&rsquo;re constantly amazed by the applications and services that grow up  around the Twitter platform. External developers have created tools and  applications enabling an incredible array of uses; we\'ve seen Twitter  accounts that help people stay updated on their <a title=\"Twitter: LAFD\" href=\"http://twitter.com/LAFD\">city&rsquo;s emergency services</a>, connect to <a title=\"Twitter: CDCemergency\" href=\"http://twitter.com/cdcemergency\">national health alerts</a>, and catch up on the happenings of their <a title=\"Twitter: TowerBridge\" href=\"http://twitter.com/twrbrdg_itself\">local bridge</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Most users will not need to review this document; however, some  people are keen on automation. Unfortunately, spammers have also taken  advantage of automation, to the frustration of genuine users. This page  has information on what account automations are allowed and which ones  could get your account filtered from search or even suspended or  terminated.</p>\r\n<h2>How Automation Works</h2>\r\n<p>In order for an outside party to post to your account or perform  other account actions (like following), you have to grant them access by  either establishing a Twitter Connection or by giving them your  username and password. Please see our help page on <a title=\"How to connect to third-party applications\" href=\"https://support.twitter.com/articles/76052-how-to-connect-and-revoke-third-party-applications\">Connecting to Third-Party Applications</a> for information on the difference, and how to revoke access for each method.</p>\r\n<p>Ultimately, you are responsible for the updates to your timeline and  the actions of your account, which means you shouldn\'t give control of  your account to a third-party unless you\'ve thoroughly investigated the  application. If you decide to automate any account actions, you will  need to manage your automations carefully to avoid violating the <a title=\"Twitter Rules\" href=\"https://support.twitter.com/articles/18311-the-twitter-rules\">Twitter Rules</a>.  Violating these rules may result in account suspension or termination,  or your account being filtered from search, regardless of whether you  performed the violation manually, or allowed an automation to do so!</p>\r\n<h2>Automating your Tweets</h2>\r\n<h3>Automating Your Tweets Based on an Action You\'ve Completed</h3>\r\n<p>Maybe you want to post to your Twitter timeline whenever you upload a  video to YouTube, create a new photo album, or beat a high score in  your favorite game? Sounds great! It&rsquo;s generally fine to update your  Twitter account when you complete a particular action. Just be  careful&mdash;if you post similar updates too frequently, your followers might  get a little bored!</p>\r\n<h3>Automating Your Tweets by Streaming External Information</h3>\r\n<p>If you want to automate your account with a feed from your personal  blog or updates from your RSS feed, please consider the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li> <strong>Feeds of your own blog: </strong>It&rsquo;s generally fine to automate your account with updates of your own content; just be sure to review the <a title=\"Twitter Rules\" href=\"https://support.twitter.com/articles/18311-the-twitter-rules\">Twitter Rules</a> before setting up your automation.</li>\r\n<li> <strong>Feeds that go through redirects or ad pages:</strong> If you\'re  posting automated links that redirect through landing or ad pages before  the final content, your account may be suspended for posting misleading  links, a violation of the <a title=\"Twitter Rules\" href=\"https://support.twitter.com/articles/18311-the-twitter-rules\">Twitter Rules</a>.</li>\r\n<li> <strong>Feeds for community benefit: </strong>We welcome feeds that are  used for community benefit or provide non-commercial information to a  niche group of users, such as local weather feeds or transit  information.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Automatically Tweeting to Trending Topics</h2>\r\n<p>Trending topics are the most tweeted-about topics on Twitter. Posting  to current trending topics in an automated fashion can degrade the  experience for other users, and may result in your account being  automatically <a title=\"I can\'t find myself in search!\" href=\"https://support.twitter.com/articles/42646-twitter-search-best-practices\">filtered from search</a>. If this happens, your followers will still see your tweets but you won\'t show in search results.</p>\r\n<p>Automating your tweets to include references to <strong>unrelated</strong> trending topics will result in account suspension.</p>\r\n<h2>Mass-creating Automated Accounts</h2>\r\n<p>There are legitimate reasons why users may have multiple accounts.  Creating serial or bulk accounts with overlapping use, however, is  prohibited. Please <a title=\"New Help Request\" href=\"http://support.twitter.com/requests/new\">file a support ticket</a> if you have questions on appropriate use. Include the list of accounts  and your planned use of each account; accounts with overlapping use  cases are generally not approved.</p>\r\n<p>We have allowed multiple, automated accounts for community benefit.  For example, Twitter users can now find out when the Hubble passes  overhead, whether they&rsquo;re in <a title=\"Twitter: OverSanFran\" href=\"http://twitter.com/oversanfran\">San Francisco</a> or <a title=\"Twitter: Over Hong Kong\" href=\"http://twitter.com/overhongkong\">Hong Kong</a>. Such accounts are generally <a title=\"Twitter Search Best Practices\" href=\"http://support.twitter.com/articles/42646\">filtered from search results</a> as they often post similar updates across multiple accounts. Users  operating serial accounts must maintain them within the Twitter Rules,  and violations may result in permanent suspension of all related  accounts.</p>\r\n<h3>Automated Advertising Updates</h3>\r\n<p>We are continuing to consider the issue of advertising on the Twitter  platform. We\'re committed to encouraging and supporting individuals and  businesses who want to discuss and promote the products they care  about. At the same time, we&rsquo;ve also seen an increase in the number of  fully-automated, spam accounts promoting affiliate offers. These  accounts use automated following, automated @replying, and serial  account creation to spam other users with mass-created advertising.  These behaviors are all prohibited by the <a title=\"Twitter Rules\" href=\"https://support.twitter.com/articles/18311-the-twitter-rules\">Twitter Rules</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The guidelines in this section are meant to both reduce automated  spam on Twitter, and provide guidance for users interested in including  advertising for others in their timeline.</p>\r\n<h3>Automated or mass-created affiliate advertising is not permitted on Twitter.</h3>\r\n<p>Updates that are posted automatically to your account through a tool  or third-party application, for which you are compensated (whether on a  \"per-click,\" \"per-sale,\" \"per-tweet,\" or other basis), are prohibited.</p>\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re still thinking about the full spectrum of advertising on  Twitter; in the meantime, other forms of advertising and promotion are  allowed, but subject to the rules in this document. The following forms  of advertising are not prohibited:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Promoting your own business or website. </li>\r\n<li>Tweeting unpaid consumer recommendations.</li>\r\n<li>Tweeting sponsored or compensated links and updates that you have manually posted or approved.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Your tweets may be sponsored by a third-party if you manually post or  approve each sponsored tweet before it is posted. These updates may not  be automated or scheduled in advance. The following rules also apply:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>All sponsored or paid updates must be manually approved. You should  either manually post these to your account, or individually approve the  tweets to be posted to your account.</li>\r\n<li>You shouldn\'t repeatedly post the same ad updates.</li>\r\n<li>If you\'re using a third-party tool or application to approve and post your tweets, it must be an application <strong>with Twitter OAuth approval</strong>. Please see the FAQ below for more information.</li>\r\n<li>You should disclose when you post a compensated or sponsored update. </li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Users combining advertising with other automations should be particularly careful to review the <a title=\"Twitter Rules\" href=\"https://support.twitter.com/articles/18311-the-twitter-rules\">Twitter Rules</a> and <a title=\"Follow Limits and Best Practices\" href=\"https://support.twitter.com/articles/68916-following-rules-and-best-practices\">Follow Rules and Best Practices</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, please do not attempt to circumvent our guidelines on  automated advertising by creating lots of bot accounts that promote  similar or duplicate websites (or websites with scraped content); these  accounts may be permanently suspended or terminated.</p>\r\n<h2>Automating other Account Actions</h2>\r\n<p>When you&rsquo;re automating account behaviors like @replies, mentions,  DMs, and retweets, we recommend you follow a general guideline: be nice  to other Twitter users. In general, we take a skeptical view of  disingenuous social action. If your actions are annoying a bunch of  Twitter users, you probably will want to rethink or adjust your  automation. Here are some more specific guidelines.</p>\r\n<h3>Automated @Replies and Mentions</h3>\r\n<p>The @reply and Mention functions are intended to make communication  between users easier, and automating these processes to place  unsolicited messages into lots of users&rsquo; reply tabs is considered an  abuse of feature. If you are automatically sending @reply messages or  Mentions to a bunch of users, the recipients must request or approve  this action in advance. For example, sending automated @replies based on  keyword searches is not permitted.</p>\r\n<p>Users should also have an easy way to opt-out of your service (in  addition to the requirement that all users must opt-in before receiving  the messages). We review blocks and reports of spam, so you&rsquo;ll need to  provide a clear way for users to stop your messages.</p>\r\n<h3>Automated Retweeting of Other Users</h3>\r\n<p>Retweeting someone means you think your followers should see their  tweet. When you&rsquo;re retweeting in an automated fashion, and especially  based on an automated search or keyword, this becomes less true.</p>\r\n<p>We discourage the automatic retweeting of other users based on a  particular keyword and may suspend or terminate accounts that engage in  this behavior, particularly if they are being frequently blocked and  reported as spam by the users they are retweeting. If you are retweeting  users just so they will see your update in their replies folder and  look at your account, this is akin to @reply spam and your account may  be suspended or terminated.</p>\r\n<h3>Automated Following and Un-Following</h3>\r\n<p>Twitter users often review the profiles and recent tweets of their  new followers. Being followed in a bulk, automated fashion can make this  process bothersome and makes Twitter a less fun place to hang out.</p>\r\n<p>The only auto-following behavior Twitter allows is auto-follow-back  (following a user after they have followed you). Automated un-following  is also not permitted. If you find yourself frequently needing to  un-follow large numbers of users, you might consider reviewing your  criteria for following them. Please review our <a title=\"Follow Limits and Best Practices\" href=\"https://support.twitter.com/articles/68916-following-rules-and-best-practices\">Follow Rules and Best Practices</a> for a detailed discussion of following recommendations.</p>\r\n<p>Also note that in the general <a title=\"Twitter Rules\" href=\"https://support.twitter.com/articles/18311-the-twitter-rules\">Twitter Rules</a> that \"get followers fast\" applications and services are not allowed. Do not surrender your username and password to them.</p>\r\n<h3>Automating Your DMs (Direct Messages)</h3>\r\n<p>Including an automated &ldquo;thanks for following&rdquo; message to your new  followers might be annoying to some users. We do not recommend, but  generally do not regulate, this behavior; if you receive a DM you don&rsquo;t  like, you can un-follow that user and they will no longer be able to  send you messages.</p>\r\n<h3>Automation that Causes Your Account to Violate the Twitter Rules</h3>\r\n<p>If your account automation is causing your account to violate the <a title=\"Twitter Rules\" href=\"https://support.twitter.com/articles/18311-the-twitter-rules\">Twitter Rules</a> (by retweeting spam updates, repeatedly posting duplicate links, etc.),  your account may be suspended or terminated. You are responsible for  the updates on your account, so please do not add automations unless you  are confident you will be able to manage your account within the rules.</p>\r\n<h2>Other Questions (FAQ)</h2>\r\n<h3>What is an application with Twitter OAuth approval?</h3>\r\n<p>As discussed above, you may post manually-approved, compensated  tweets through a third-party application with Twitter OAuth approval. If  an application has OAuth approval, the following will be true</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>You allow the application access by approving their connection, not by giving out your username and password. </li>\r\n<li>Once approved, you&rsquo;ll be able to see and revoke the connection from your <a title=\"Account Settings: Connections Tab\" href=\"http://twitter.com/settings/applications\">Applications tab</a>.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>When Tweets come from a third-party application, the name of the source is included to the right of the time-stamp, like this:</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://si4.twimg.com/help/1307050978_55775\" border=\"0\" width=\"465\" height=\"227\" /></p>\r\n<p>Updates posted using the general API without Twitter OAuth will  instead say \"from API&rdquo; as the source. We do not allow advertising posted  through general API applications. If you find your account posting ads  such as these, please change your password and revoke unwanted  connections. You can find more information, and a technical walk-through  for allowing and revoking API access, the help page on <a title=\"Connecting to Third-Party Applications\" href=\"https://support.twitter.com/articles/76052-how-to-connect-and-revoke-third-party-applications\">Connecting to Third-Party Applications.</a></p>',99,0,0,'',NULL,NULL),

 (452,'Following Rules and Best Practices','<p>Following is a way to receive information, in the form of tweets,  from a person, company, or organization. If an account seems  interesting, you can follow that account and see their updates in your  timeline. This page discusses some of the limits and best practices  regarding following on Twitter.</p>\r\n<h3>What are the limits?</h3>\r\n<p>We don&rsquo;t limit the number of followers you can have. However, we do  monitor how aggressively users follow other users. We try to make sure  that none of our limits restrain reasonable usage, and will not affect  most Twitter users.</p>\r\n<p>We monitor all accounts for aggressive following and follow churn  (repeatedly following and un-following large numbers of other users).  You can read more about these below, but if you don&rsquo;t follow or  un-follow hundreds of users in a single day, and you aren&rsquo;t using  automated methods of following users, you should be fine. Please note  that the only automated following behavior that Twitter allows is  auto-follow-back (following a user after they have followed you).  Automated un-following is also not permitted. Please review our <a title=\"Automation Rules and Best Practices\" href=\"https://support.twitter.com/articles/76915-automation-rules-and-best-practices\">Automation Rules and Best Practices</a> for more information on automating your account.</p>\r\n<h3>What is aggressive following?</h3>\r\n<p>Following users is a way to see their updates in your timeline. If an  account seems interesting, feel free to follow it! Many Twitter users  receive email notifications when someone follows their account or check  out the profiles of new followers to see if they share common interests.  If some accounts are aggressively or indiscriminately following  hundreds of accounts just to garner attention, it makes Twitter a  less-nice place to hang out.</p>\r\n<h3>What is aggressive follow churn?</h3>\r\n<p>If you decide to follow someone and then change your mind later,  that&rsquo;s fine! You can just visit the person&rsquo;s profile page and then  un-follow them. Aggressive follow churn is when an account repeatedly  follows and un-follows large numbers of users. This may be done to get  lots of people to notice them, to circumvent a Twitter limit, or to  change their follower-to-following ratio.</p>\r\n<p>These behaviors negatively impact the Twitter experience for other  users, are common spam tactics, and may lead to account suspension.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Additional limits if you are following 2000 or more people:</strong></p>\r\n<p>The rules about aggressive following and follow churn still apply. In  addition, every user can follow 2000 people total. Once you&rsquo;ve followed  2000 users, there are limits to the number of additional users you can  follow: this limit is different for every user and is based on your  ratio of followers to following. When you hit this limit, we&rsquo;ll tell you  by showing an error message in your browser. You&rsquo;ll need to wait until  you have more followers in order to follow more users&mdash;basically, you  can\'t follow 10,000 people if only 100 people follow you. When you reach  a daily or total limit and we show you an error message, you\'ve hit a  technical limit imposed to limit egregious behavior by spam accounts and  to prevent strain on the site. These are just the <span>technical</span> limits for your account; in addition, you are prohibited from  aggressive following behaviors. These behaviors may result in account  suspension, regardless of your account\'s technical ratio.</p>\r\n<p>Limits improve site performance by ensuring that when we send a  person\'s message to all of their followers, the sending of that message  is meaningful. Follow limits cannot be lifted by Twitter, and everyone  is subject to them, including verified and developer accounts. Based on  current behavior in the Twitter community, we\'ve concluded that this is  both fair and reasonable.</p>\r\n<h3>Why does Twitter monitor following behavior at all? Isn&rsquo;t this a social network?</h3>\r\n<p>Twitter facilitates social networking, but it\'s not a social  networking website. In fact, Twitter works quite differently from social  networks: when you accept friend requests on social networks, it  usually means you appear in that person\'s network and they appear in  yours. Following on Twitter is different, because instead of indicating a  mutual relationship, following is a one-way action that means you want  to receive information, in the form of tweets, from someone. Twitter  allows people to opt-in to (or opt-out of) receiving a person\'s updates  without requiring mutual following.</p>\r\n<p>If you follow too many people, there&rsquo;s no way you can keep up with  everyone\'s updates in your timeline. If you need to communicate with  someone but don\'t need to see their updates everyday, you don\'t have to  follow them. Send them an @reply when you need to; it doesn\'t require  following and your update will appear in the person\'s replies tab, so  they can reply back.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, limits on Twitter alleviate some of the strain on the  invisible part of Twitter, which prevents error pages and downtime on  the visible part. For the sake of reliability, we\'ve placed limits on  actions like following, API requests per hour, and number of updates per  day (<a title=\"Following and Updating Limits\" href=\"https://support.twitter.com/articles/15364-about-twitter-limits-update-api-dm-and-following\">see this page for more information on updating and API limits</a>).</p>\r\n<p>Finally, follower violations are one tactic that spammers often use  to abuse Twitter, so monitoring for abuse is one way to reduce spam on  Twitter.</p>\r\n<h3>Using Third Party Applications to &ldquo;Get More Followers Fast!&rdquo;</h3>\r\n<p>You may encounter websites or applications claiming they can help you  get lots of followers quickly. These programs may ask for payment for  followers, or ask you to follow a list of other users in order to  participate. <a title=\"Twitter Rules\" href=\"https://support.twitter.com/articles/18311-the-twitter-rules\">The Twitter Rules</a> addresses the use of these programs by disallowing:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Using or promoting third-party sites that claim to get you more  followers (such as follower trains, sites promising &lsquo;more followers  fast,&rsquo; or any other site that offers to automatically add followers to  your account).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>When you give out your username and password to another site or  application, you are giving control of your account to someone else.  They may then post duplicated, spam, or malicious updates and links,  send unwanted direct messages, aggressively follow, or violate other  Twitter rules with your account. When these applications do add  followers to your account, they are often abandoned or bot accounts that  are not reading your updates. If a third-party application causes your  account to violate the Twitter Rules, your account may be suspended.</p>\r\n<p>Some third-party applications have been implicated in spam behavior,  fraud, the selling of usernames and passwords, and phishing. Please do  not give your username and password out to any third-party application  that you have not thoroughly researched.</p>\r\n<p>Revoke access for any third-party application that you don\'t recognize by visiting the <a href=\"http://twitter.com/settings/applications\">Applications tab</a> in Account Settings.</p>\r\n<h3>Following limits? But I\'m whitelisted!</h3>\r\n<p>Some API administrators have whitelist status so their applications  can function without hitting certain system limits. Whitelisting means  that an application can have more API requests per hour; it does not  increase the follow limits. All whitelisted accounts are still subject  to follow limits.</p>\r\n<h3>So how am I supposed to get followers?</h3>\r\n<p>Remember, Twitter isn&rsquo;t a race to get the most followers. If you  follow users that you&rsquo;re interested in, it&rsquo;s more likely that legitimate  users will find you and read your updates. People follow other users on  Twitter to read updates that are interesting to them. Aggressively  following and un-following accounts is frustrating to other Twitter  users, and degrades the Twitter experience for everyone.</p>',27,1,0,'',NULL,NULL),
 (449,'About Elooi Limits','<p>Limits alleviate some of the strain on the behind-the-scenes part of  Twitter, and reduce downtime and error pages. For the sake of  reliability, we\'ve placed some limits on account actions like following,  API requests, direct messages, and updates.</p>\r\n<h2>Current Twitter Limits</h2>\r\n<p>The current technical limits for accounts are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li> <strong>Direct Messages</strong>: 250 per day.</li>\r\n<li> <strong>Updates</strong>: 1,000 per day. The daily update limit is  further broken down into smaller limits for semi-hourly intervals.  Retweets are counted as updates.</li>\r\n<li> <strong>Changes to Account Email</strong>: 4 per hour.</li>\r\n<li> <strong>Following (daily)</strong>: Please note that this is a technical  account limit only, and there are additional rules prohibiting  aggressive following behavior. You can find detailed page describing  following limits and prohibited behavior on the <a title=\"Follow Limits and Best Practices page\" href=\"https://support.twitter.com/articles/68916-following-rules-and-best-practices\">Follow Limits and Best Practices Page</a>. The technical follow limit is 1,000 per day.</li>\r\n<li> <strong>Following (account-based)</strong>: Once an account is following 2,000 other users, additional follow attempts are limited by account-specific ratios. The <a title=\"Follow Limits and Best Practices page\" href=\"https://support.twitter.com/articles/68916-following-rules-and-best-practices\">Follow Limits and Best Practices Page</a> has more information. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>These limits include actions from all devices including web, mobile,  phone, API, etc. API requests from all third-party applications are  tracked against the hourly API limit. People who use multiple  third-party applications with their account will therefore reach the API  limit more quickly. For more information on this topic, please see our <a href=\"http://support.twitter.com/articles/160385\">API Rate Limiting Page</a>.</p>\r\n<p>These limits may be temporarily reduced during periods of heavy site usage. In such cases, we will post an update at the <a title=\"Twitter Status Blog\" href=\"http://status.twitter.com/\">Twitter Status blog</a>.</p>\r\n<h2>What happens if I hit a limit?</h2>\r\n<p>If you do reach a limit, we\'ll let you know with an error message  telling you which limit you\'ve hit. For limits that are time-based (like  the DM Messages, Update, Changes to Account Email, and API Requests  Limits), you\'ll be able to try again after the time has elapsed.</p>\r\n<p>The Update Limit of 1,000 updates per day is further broken down into  semi-hourly intervals.

 (444,'Frequently Asked Questions','<h2>Getting to know Twitter</h2>\r\n<h3>What is it?</h3>\r\n<p>Twitter is a service for friends, family, and co&ndash;workers to  communicate and stay connected through the exchange of quick, frequent  messages. People write short updates,<span> often called \"Tweets\" of 140 characters or fewer. These messages are posted to your profile or <a href=\"https://support.twitter.com/articles/15354-about-twitter-widgets\">your blog</a>, sent to your <a href=\"https://support.twitter.com/articles/14019-what-is-following\">followers</a>, and are searchable on Twitter search.</span></p>\r\n<h3>Do I need anything special to use it?</h3>\r\n<p>All you need to use Twitter is an internet connection or a mobile phone. <a href=\"http://twitter.com/signup\">Join us here</a>!  Once you\'re in, type your first update into the web box. To get an idea  of what other people are saying or doing on Twitter, check out <a href=\"http://search.twitter.com/\">Twitter search</a> to see what Twitter\'s all about. You can search by keyword or just  check out the trending topics to see what\'s hot on Twitter right now.</p>\r\n<h3>How do I find my friends?</h3>\r\n<p>When you create an account, you can <a href=\"http://twitter.com/invitations/find_on_twitter\">search for people</a> by name or user name, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/invitations/find_on_other_networks\">import friends</a> from other networks, or <a href=\"http://twitter.com/invitations/invite_by_email\">invite friends via email</a>. If you don\'t want to do that, follow some of the people<a href=\"http://twitter.com/invitations/suggestions\"> we\'ve suggested</a>. Once you\'ve found your friends, <a href=\"https://support.twitter.com/articles/14019-what-is-following\">follow them</a> to start getting their updates.</p>\r\n<h3>What does it mean to follow someone on Twitter?</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://support.twitter.com/articles/14019-what-is-following\">Following</a> someone simply means receiving their Twitter updates.  When you follow  someone, every time they post a new message, it will appear on your  Twitter home page. New messages are added to your home page as people  post them, so you always get the updates in real time. When you log in,  you can see what the latest updates are. Twitter offers other ways to  follow people too: you can get updates from certain people on your<a href=\"https://support.twitter.com/articles/14589-how-to-add-your-phone-via-sms\"> phone</a>!</p>\r\n<h3>Who reads my updates?</h3>\r\n<p>It\'s up to you. Your followers read your updates, and anyone else who  comes across them in a search. Your Twitter profile is public by  default; if you\'re hesitant to have strangers read your updates, <a href=\"https://support.twitter.com/articles/14016-about-public-and-protected-accounts\">protect your profile</a> to approve followers and keep your updates out of search.</p>\r\n<h3>Can I block people from following me?</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://support.twitter.com/articles/15355-how-to-unfollow-users-on-twitter\">Yes, you can</a>.  If you block someone, they won\'t be able to follow you or send you any  messages. If your account is public, they\'ll still be able to view it,  but they won\'t show up on your followers list, and you won\'t be on their  following list. If it\'s a spammer you\'re blocking, thanks! Twitter  Support keeps an eye on block reports to see who\'s getting in trouble on  Twitter.</p>\r\n<h3>How can I send updates to Twitter?</h3>\r\n<p>Twitter offers many ways to post updates: <a href=\"https://support.twitter.com/articles/15367-how-to-post-a-tweet\">from the web</a> in the update box, <a href=\"https://support.twitter.com/articles/14589-how-to-add-your-phone-via-sms\">from your phone</a>,  from your mobile web browser using m.twitter.com, or from any third  party application made by the talented folks who\'ve utilized our <a href=\"http://apiwiki.twitter.com/\">API</a>.</p>\r\n<h3>What are @Replies?</h3>\r\n<p>An @reply is a public message sent from one person to another,  distinguished from normal updates by the @username prefix. If a message  begins with @username, we collect it as a reply. Reply publicly to any  update on Twitter by using the @username format. Following is not  necessary to reply to someone, and all of your replies are visible in  the @username tab in your home page sidebar. (Tweets with @username  elsewhere in the Tweet are also collected in your sidebar tab; Tweets  starting with @username are replies, and Tweets with @username elsewhere  are considered mentions.) Please note that if your account is private,  users who are not following you will not see your @replies or mentions.</p>\r\n<h3>Can I edit a Tweet once I post it?</h3>\r\n<p>Nope. Once it\'s out there, you can\'t edit it. You can delete an  update by clicking the trash icon on the right end of the update, but  you can\'t make changes.</p>\r\n<h3>What is the difference between an @reply and a direct message?</h3>\r\n<p>An <a href=\"https://support.twitter.com/articles/14023-what-are-replies-and-mentions\">@reply</a> is a public message sent regardless of follow-ship that anyone can view. A <a href=\"https://support.twitter.com/articles/14606-what-is-a-direct-message-dm\">direct message</a> can only be sent by someone you follow, and is a private message that only the author and recipient can view.</p>\r\n<h3>What does RT, or retweet, mean?</h3>\r\n<p>RT is short for retweet, and indicates a re-posting of someone else\'s Tweet. This isn\'t an official Twitter <a href=\"https://support.twitter.com/articles/14020-twitter-sms-commands\">command</a> or feature, but people add RT somewhere in a Tweet to indicate that  part of their Tweet includes something they\'re re-posting from another  person\'s Tweet, sometimes with a comment of their own.

You can find step-by-step instructions and more FAQ <a href=\"http://support.twitter.com/articles/20156423\">here</a>.</p>\r\n<h3>Is there a Twitter API?</h3>\r\n<p>Yes, complete with documentation and an active developer group to  help you with common API questions. You can find it at the bottom of  your logged-in homepage, <a href=\"https://dev.twitter.com/\">here</a>.</p>\r\n<h3>Does Twitter allow HTML in web updates?</h3>\r\n<p>No. We escape all HTML for security purposes. However, if you paste  in a link that is less than 30 characters, we\'ll post it in its  entirety. If it\'s longer than 30 characters, we\'ll convert it to a  shorter URL.</p>\r\n<h3>How do I report spam?</h3>\r\n<p>Report spam by following <a href=\"http://twitter.com/spam\">Twitter\'s spam watch account</a>,  and sending us a direct message containing the username of the spammer.  We encourage you to always block any spammers you find. Twitter\'s  Safety team keeps an eye on block reports to see who\'s getting in  trouble on Twitter.</p>\r\n<h3>Why are accounts suspended?</h3>\r\n<p>Accounts are suspended for Terms of Service violations or spam investigation.
